     "description":"Ahsoka Tano was a female Togruta who trained as a Jedi Padawan during the Clone Wars. She was trained by Anakin Skywalker and, alongside her master, commanded troopers from the Grand Army of the Republic for most of the war. She was expelled from the Jedi Order after being falsely implicated as the culprit in a bombing at the Jedi Temple, and she was put on trial by the Galactic Republic before the true bomber, her friend Barriss Offee, was discovered. Despite the Jedi Council allowing her to return to the Order, Tano became disillusioned with the Council and their lack of trust in her, and she chose to leave the Order.After the rise of the Galactic Empire, Tano became part of a rebel movement against the Empire, working with Senator Bail Organa of Alderaan. She took on the codename 'Fulcrum' and was in contact with numerous rebel cells, including the crew of the Ghost which operated on and around Lothal."
