Haunted by the memory of his mother's death by Tusken Raiders along with his desire to protect those he loved, he became privy to Darth Sidious's manipulation and ultimately fell to the Dark Side of the Force. He went on to become the epitony of darkness and fear for decades as Emperor Palpatine's enforcer, until his final redemption by his son Luke Skywalker."

Kreia's quest indeed led her astray; she sought contrast with the Jedi ways by opening herself up to the dark side of the Force, but she was overwhelmed by the darkness on the Sith world of Malachor V, where the Mandalorian Wars that Revan waged culminated in the deadly activation of the Mass Shadow Generator superweapon. The echoes of the Malachor tragedy proved overbearing, transforming Kreia into the bitter Sith Lord Darth Traya."
